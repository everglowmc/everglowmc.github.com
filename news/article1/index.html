<p>The TrappedSMP began on February 25th, 2021. That day was meant as a stress test, and it certainly stressed the servers beyond belief. With immense lag and a confusing queue system, it wasn’t going well. PvP was running rampant, with no reason to stop. Those who managed to escape couldn’t go far, the worldborder wasn’t large and you couldn’t even see it. If you managed to reach it and accidentally run into it, you would be back at spawn and back to square one. Insanity and complaints ensued. People began banding together, forming factions that had been planned for weeks such as the Nexus Empire or Kings of the End (henceforth referred to as KotE). Things began to calm down as the lag from the sheer number of players in one place declined. But, of course, some decided that peace wasn’t an option. KotE ran to the End Dimension as fast as possible, securing the Egg within the first day (as I’m told) of the TrappedSMP’s release. Clownpierce, the now-infamous PvPer, began his reign of terror as he attacked mercilessly, seemingly knowing what to do at every turn. He streamed this, his kills happening live. Of course, we wouldn’t find out until much later that he had planted a spy within the ranks of various factions. During this time, factions began setting up for the long haul. Bases were made, alliances formed and broken in a matter of hours. Everyone in the server had come out stumbling and few had managed to land on their feet. Magicgum added the Reputation System, a controversial mechanic that applied debuffs to player killers such as Clownpierce. He also added the much more disputed Land Claims, 64x64 claim blocks for factions over 40 people, designed to foster growth and building. This was almost immediately abused to claim the (at the time) only End Portal, locking out many from entering. People kicked and screamed, but there was barely anything done about it. Nexus allied with various factions, including the Merchant’s Guild, a rising trade company. Religions began to emerge such as the Children of Grand Floppa. It seemed everything was beginning to calm down, especially when Clownpierce left the server for good. Unfortunately, the residents of the SMP would make their own chaos. Lavacasts over spawn got worse as the days went on, players killing players for fun as well. Whitelists came in waves, meaning laggy surges of new players came every now and then, agitating people.</p>

<h1 class="newstitle">Nexus Falls</h1>
<p>KotE decided that they would take matters into their own hands as their legion of talented soldiers, the Watchers, was agitated by factions such as Nexus and the Brethren of the Coast Pirates (BotC). Raids began happening on Nexus towards the end of the second week, and these events were a massive morale hit as people began giving up, leaving the server. They simply couldn’t stand up to KotE’s force, some claiming that the Watchers had “like 6 totems[of undying] each,”. It seemed that this spelled the end of 2 major players within the server. But according to recent information, Nexus is experiencing a passing on of power to a new leader and hasn’t quite given in. Maybe they will rise to the stature they once stood at? Or is this just a drawn-out death for a once-great faction?</p>
<h1 class="newstitle">An Economy Rises</h1>
<p>The release of Everdollar, a digital currency, marks the entrance into a new age for the TrappedSMP. No longer, will trade be had with bartering for diamonds. No more are untrustworthy wages. With E$, factions can rise to the next level. With a discord and a website, it’s likely to take off. However, it has faced problems as of late, because their discord bot has been experiencing random hours of being offline likely because of lag. It’s being looked into, but be wary. 
Everdollar will help foster new trade as you don’t need to be in the server to use it. It allows taxation, wages, you name it. It’s clear that I, as a writer, am overjoyed by this currency and will be using it for the future.
